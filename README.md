## About the Project
The project contains four Python files: distance_calculator.py, tourist_guide_app.py, testFile.py, and format.py 
The Tourist Guide Application is a Python-based solution designed to enhance travel planning by providing detailed information about various tourist attractions across African countries. This app allows users to view attractions by country, search for specific destinations, and calculate the distance and estimated travel time between their current location and their destination. The app integrates with MySQL to store and manage data for attractions, offering a robust and scalable backend. By leveraging geocoding services and user-friendly menus, the application aims to make exploring and navigating new destinations easier and more accessible for travelers.
Distance_calculator.py is a Python program that calculates the distance between any two locations and gives an approximation of travel time on foot, car, and motorcycle. It makes use of a library called Geopy for geocoding and computing distances. 

The TouristGuideApp.py file implements a tourist guide application to enhance and promote tourism. It provides detailed information about attractions, including their location, description, best visiting time, entry fees, and activities.

Users can also search for attractions, view countries where tourist spots are available, calculate the distance to the destination they want to travel to, and the time it takes. This supports our mission with a complete website for travelers to plan tours easily and conveniently, thereby encouraging tourism through easy access to crucial
