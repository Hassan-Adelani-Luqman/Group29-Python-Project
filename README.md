Our team has made substantial progress on the Tourist Guide App:

Main Menu: The main menu is active, capable of giving the directions to view the available countries, search for attractions or quit the app; options can be selected through digits or names to prevent complexities.

Country Selection: This feature enables a user to see a list of African countries and then choose a country to highlight freetravel destinations in. It is actually employed in use and improves the function and value of the application for the people who use it.

Attraction Details: Yes the attraction details are all filled to the brim providing detailed information on each site with descriptions, location, ideal time to visit, fees and activities to be done while there enabling the users to get more information about each attractive site.

Search Functionality: Fortunately, itâ€™s still a progress in development, so now, we are paying more attention to improving the search function for the effective data filtering.
